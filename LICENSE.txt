Copyright (c) <YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDER>

Permission is granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this
software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use the
Software **for personal, non-commercial purposes only**, subject to the
following conditions.

1. Personal Use Only
   ------------------
   You may use, run, and interact with the Software on devices you personally
   control for private, non-commercial uses. "Personal" means use by an
   individual for that individual's private or household purposes and does not
   include sale, rental, commercial deployment, hosting, or any use that
   directly or indirectly generates revenue (monetary or equivalent) for a
   person or organization.

2. Modifications and Publishing
   -----------------------------
   You may modify the Software (create "Modified Works") and publish or
   distribute those Modified Works **freely** under the terms of this same
   license, provided that:
   a. The Modified Work continues to be available only for personal, non-
      commercial use (see Section 1).
   b. The Modified Work is licensed under this same Personal Use & Mods
      License (PUML). Recipients of the Modified Work must receive the same
      permissions and restrictions.
   c. You include, in the Modified Work's repository or distribution, an
      explicit link to the original project (the "OG repo") and a short
      notice describing the changes you made.

3. Notification
   --------------
   If you publish or distribute a Modified Work publicly (for example on a
   public code host or download site), you agree to make a reasonable effort
   to notify the original copyright holder at:
      <CONTACT_EMAIL_OR_HANDLE>
   Notification may be a brief message stating the name of the Modified Work,
   link to the Modified Work, and the OG repo link. Failure to notify does not
   invalidate the license grant, but notification is requested as a courtesy.

4. Attribution
   ------------
   Redistributions of the Software or any Modified Work must include the
   copyright notice above and a copy of this license. In addition, include
   the OG repo link:
      Original repository: <OG_REPO_URL>

5. No Fees or Royalties
   ---------------------
   No fee, royalty, or licensing charge of any kind may be imposed on the use,
   distribution, or publication of the Software or any Modified Work beyond the
   obligations in this license (notification and OG repo link). C
